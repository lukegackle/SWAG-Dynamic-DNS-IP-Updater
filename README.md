# SWAG-Dynamic-DNS-IP-Updater
The purpose of this repository is to provide a script that resolved the current IP address of your DDNS provider and writes it to a file so that you can use that to allow access to your services from your own public IP address with the IP restrictions that you require.

There is a full walkthrough on how to apply the files in this repository at the following link:
